# Advent of code 2022 :christmas_tree:


## About
[Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) is a advent calendar with small programming challenges published every day from 1 to 25 of December every year since 2015.
 
[Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) with community gathered around this event.

This repo will contain my Python 3.8 solutions to [2022 edition of Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022).



## Project structure
Each day will be in separate directory with 3 files:

- input.txt - file with input from website
- part1.py - file with solution to first part of the task
- part2.py - file with solution to second part of the task
